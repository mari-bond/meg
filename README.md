Welcome to the interview task
=============================

If something is not clear or you need help - just ask. Nobody knows everything!

Task - Weathermap API
---------------------

The app you have to implement is using the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather) JSON API.

Please implement the following features into a web application (Rails, AngularJS, etc.):

* Display the weather information at random geographic coordinates
* Implement a form with input fields for `city' and `country'. On submit the weather information for this city is fetched and displayed.
  - Optional: Cache the fetched weather in an active-record object
* Gracefully handle the case where the city could not be found and display the information to the user

Please follow these 4 rules
---------------------------

1. Create a project of your choice (Rails, AngularJS, etc.)
2. Please implement the project according to your own best standards, possibly
   - Tests, TDD
   - Code guidelines
   - Structure / architecture
   - Refactoring
   - Conventions
   - More commits than just one
3. Please send the (zipped) repository to marc.schuba@mobileeventguide.de
4. Good luck and have fun!

Please note: do not invest more than 2-3 hours on completing this task. We
want to look at the approach you took to solving the problem and not the end
result per se.
